@article{car02,
abstract = {We investigate the importance of diffusion and jumps in a new model for asset returns. In contrast to standard models, we allow for jump components displaying finite or infinite activity and variation. Empirical investigations of time series indicate that index dynamics are devoid of a diffusion component, which may be present in the dynamics of individual stocks. This leads to the conjecture, confirmed on options data, that the risk-neutral process should be free of a diffusion component. We conclude that the statistical and risk-neutral processes for equity prices are pure jump processes of infinite activity and finite variation.},

@article{cui17,
abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for a complete and efficient calibration of the Heston stochastic volatility model. We express the calibration as a nonlinear least-squares problem. We exploit a suitable representation of the Heston characteristic function and modify it to avoid discontinuities caused by branch switchings of complex functions. Using this representation, we obtain the analytical gradient of the price of a vanilla option with respect to the model parameters, which is the key element of all variants of the objective function. The interdependence between the components of the gradient enables an efficient implementation which is around ten times faster than with a numerical gradient. We choose the Levenberg–Marquardt method to calibrate the model and do not observe multiple local minima reported in previous research. Two-dimensional sections show that the objective function is shaped as a narrow valley with a flat bottom. Our method is the fastest calibration of the Heston model developed so far and meets the speed requirement of practical trading.},

abstract = {The Heston model stands out from the class of stochastic volatility (SV) models mainly for two reasons. Firstly, the process for the volatility is non-negative and mean-reverting, which is what we observe in the markets. Secondly, there exists a fast and easily implemented semi-analytical solution for European options. In this article we adapt the original work of Heston (1993) to a foreign exchange (FX) setting. We discuss the computational aspects of using the semi-analytical formulas, performing Monte Carlo simulations, checking the Feller condition, and option pricing with FFT. In an empirical study we show that the smile of vanilla options can be reproduced by suitably calibrating three out of five model parameters.},

@article{abr_2,
abstract = {A new sampling methodology based on an incomplete cosine expansion series is presented as an alternative to the traditional sinc function approach. Numerical integration shows that this methodology is efficient and practical. Applying the incomplete cosine expansion we obtain a rational approximation of the complex error function that with the same number of the summation terms provides an accuracy exceeding the Weideman's approximation accuracy by several orders of the magnitude. Application of the expansion results in an integration consisting of elementary function terms only. Consequently, this approach can be advantageous for accurate and rapid computation.},
